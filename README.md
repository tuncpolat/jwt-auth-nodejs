JWT Access/Refresh Token Authentication and Authorization REST API in Nodejs
============

This is a node.js (express) JWT authorization and authentication REST API inspired by this [blogpost by Hasura](https://hasura.io/blog/best-practices-of-using-jwt-with-graphql/).<br/>Read my blog post to get in-depth inside.

## Features
- Register user
- Login user
- Access & Refresh
- Send email verification with [nodemailer](https://nodemailer.com/usage/)
- Send password forgot instruction

---

## Front-End
I have also developed a React front-end. Check it out [here](https://www.simplweb.ch/)

---

## Setup
Clone this repo to your desktop and run `npm install` to install all the dependencies.

---

## Usage
After you clone this repo to your desktop, go to its root directory and run `npm install` to install its dependencies.

Once the dependencies are installed, you can run  `npm run dev` to start the application. The server will run on port 5000.

I suggest also clone the front-end repo and start testing it out or you can just play with Postman.
