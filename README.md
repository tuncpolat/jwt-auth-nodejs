# User Authentification and Authorization with JWT (Access and Refresh Token) in Nodejs, Express, and MongoDB.

This is a node.js (express) JWT authorization and authentication REST API inspired by this [blog post by Hasura](https://hasura.io/blog/best-practices-of-using-jwt-with-graphql/).<br/>In my blog post I try to explain how the whole JWT authentication and authorization flow with access and refresh tokens works in a MERN Stack. You can read it [here](https://simplweb.ch/en/blog/user-authentification-and-authorization-with-jwt-access-and-refresh-token-in-nodejs-react-express-and-mongo-db)

## Features

- Register user
- Login user

- Password reset

## Front-End

I have also developed a React front-end. Check it out [here]([https://github.com/tuncpolat/jwt-auth-react)

## Setup & Usage

After you clone this repo to your desktop, go to its root directory and run `npm install` to install its dependencies.

Once the dependencies are installed, you can run `npm run dev` to start the application. The server will run on port 5000.

Also, I suggest cloning the front-end repo and testing it or just using it with Postman.
